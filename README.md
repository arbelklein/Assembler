# Assembler

## Description
This repository contains a university course project that implements an assembler program. The assembler translates code written in a defined assembly language into machine code. It processes the input file, detects syntax and semantic errors, and generates an output file compatible with a simulated computer.

###Features
- Input Handling: Reads assembly language source files.
- Error Detection: Identifies syntax and semantic errors in the input files.
- *Output Generation*: Produces machine code files in a format compatible with the simulated hardware.
